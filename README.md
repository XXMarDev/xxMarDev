Hi, i'm Marco!

13 y.o

Programming languages I am familiar with:
FRONT-END
html - css - js - react js - tailwind
BACK END
express js - and the next??

Interesting facts:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on back-end.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Express Js.
- âœ¨ I'm currently working on many static projects.

I aspire to become a full stack developer. Can i do it?

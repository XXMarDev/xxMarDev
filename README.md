Hi, i'm Marco!
ðŸŽˆItaly
13 y.o

Programming languages I am familiar with:
FRONT-END <br>
html <br> - css <br> - js <br> - react js <br> - tailwind <br> <br>
BACK END
express js <br> - and the next? <br>

Interesting facts:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on back-end.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Express Js.
- âœ¨ I'm currently working on many static projects.

I aspire to become a full stack developer. Can i do it?
